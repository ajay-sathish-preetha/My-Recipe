Step 1: Preparing the icecream mix.

Combine sugar, milk, salt, and cocoa powder in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly. Bring to a simmer. Place the egg yolks into a small bowl. Gradually stir in about 1/2 cup of the hot liquid. and return to the saucepan. Heat until thickened, but do not boil. Remove from the heat, and stir in the chopped chocolate until chocolate is melted. Pour into a chilled bowl, and refrigerate for about two hours until cold, stirring occasionally.

Step 2: Making the icecream.

When chocolate mixture has completely cooled, stir in the cream, and vanilla. Pour this mixture into a ziplock bag and seal it tight.
take another bag bigger than the ziplock bag with the icecream and pour some ice or dryice with salt in a suitable amount. take the bag with the ice cream and place it inside the bigger bag with ice and salt. Seal both the bags and start squishing and pressing the icecream mix all around the ice and salt covering all the areas. repeat this process for 10 to 15 minutes or more depending on which the type of consistency of icecream that you want. After that take the icecream bag out scoop the icecream and enjoy.
